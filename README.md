# Coffee Sales Analysis

This project analyzes coffee sales data from a full year to uncover patterns and insights that can help guide business decisions. The goal was to understand customer preferences, identify top-selling beverages, and highlight opportunities for promotions or product bundling.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes sales data for eight different coffee beverages. Key columns include:

- `coffee_name` – the name of the coffee beverage  
- `sales_amount` – total revenue from each sale  
- `hour_of_day` – the hour the coffee was sold  
- `weekday` and `month_name` – to explore time-based trends  

The analysis focuses on **which drinks are most popular** and how this information can inform business decisions like marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and upselling opportunities.

## Coffee Sales by Beverage (Pie Chart)

To explore which drinks sell the most, I created a **pie chart** showing the percentage of total sales for each coffee beverage.

The chart shows that **Lattes are the top-selling drink**, followed closely by **Americanos with milk**. This insight highlights opportunities to:

- **Pair Lattes with pastries** to increase transaction value  
- **Offer special promotions on Lattes** to boost sales further  

By understanding which drinks dominate sales, the business can better plan marketing campaigns, manage inventory, and create bundles that appeal to customers.

## Next Steps

Further analysis could include:

- **Hourly and weekday trends** – examining which times see the most orders for each coffee type  
- **Cash type comparison** – understanding whether cash or card users have different beverage preferences  
- **Seasonal trends** – exploring monthly sales to inform seasonal promotions
