# Coffee Sales Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data using SQL and simple visualizations in Google Sheets.  
The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior and sales trends that could help inform business decisions.

## Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, I performed basic data cleaning steps to make sure the dataset was ready:

- Checked for duplicates and confirmed none remained.  
- Identified and removed null values (only 2 rows with missing data, which were deleted).  
- Verified no empty rows or columns remained after cleaning.  
- Confirmed the dataset is consistent and ready for analysis.

## Planned Analysis
For now, I’ve identified one analysis I want to complete:

1. **Sales by Hour of the Day**  
   - Using SQL, I will extract the hour from each sale’s timestamp.  
   - This will show what times of day customers buy the most coffee.  
   - The results will be visualized in Google Sheets using either a line chart (to show sales trends across the day) or a column chart (to clearly compare hour-to-hour totals).

2. **[Second Analysis Placeholder]**  
   - I plan to add one more analysis once I finalize the focus.  
   - This section will be updated with the query, explanation, and visualization details.

## Tools
- **SQL** → to query and analyze the raw data.  
- **Google Sheets** → to create simple, clear visualizations from query results.  
- **GitHub** → to document the process and share the project.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the second analysis.  
- Run SQL queries and export results.  
- Create charts in Google Sheets.  
- Add insights and conclusions based on the findings.
